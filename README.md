# Arterial-Vessels-U-Net

This repository contains all code for our paper "Investigating the impact of pulmonary arterial vessel diameter on U-Net segmentation accuracy during early-stage training." In this study, we developed and trained a U-Net model to segment arterial vessels from 609 micrographs of histology slides obtained from male Wistar rats induced with pulmonary hypertension (iPAH and CTEPH).
